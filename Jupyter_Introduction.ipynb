    "The basic element of every Jupyter notebook is the cell.  Every cell is either a **markdown cell**, or a **code cell**.  The markdown cells mostly contain text, LaTex code, and a few formatting codes.  When executed, these cells generate formatted text and formulas.  The code cells contain instructions, written in Python, to be executed by the interpreter.  Code cells will not produce much visual output to the notebook unless they contain specific instructions to do so.    \n",
    "\n",
    "All cells in the notebooks, markdown and code, must be executed in order to produce output and results.  To execute a cell, select the cell and press 'Shift + Enter'.  You can select a cell by clicking it, or by moving up/down with the arrow keys. In order to edit a cell, you must enter **edit mode**.  When not in edit mode, the notebook is said to be in **command mode**.  \n",

The bar will be green in edit mode and blue in command mode.  To enter command mode we press 'Enter'.  To exit command mode without executing the cell we press 'Esc'.  To execute the cell press 'Shift + Enter'.  \n",

These errors might be difficult to decipher at first, but with a little practice in reading the messages you will be able to understand the common errors that arise.  **If there is anything amiss in a markdown cell, there will be no error message**, although the displayed text or formula may not look correct.  The markdown cells are not executed in the same sense as the code cells.  \n",

This means that when you first open a notebook, the formatted text and formulas produced by the markdown cells will be displayed.  Clicking on the markdown cells will not do anything other than select the cell, and pressing 'Shift + Enter' will not display anything new since the output is already displayed.  By contrast, the output from the code cells might be displayed, but the code in the cell does not get executed by the Notebook until the cell has been run explicity by selecting the cell and pressing 'Shift + Enter'.  It will be quite common for the code in once cell to depend on code in earlier cell.  **If the code cells are executed in the wrong order, we may get error messages or other unexpected results.** "
